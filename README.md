# DSA-TS

A collection of fundamental data structures and algorithms implemented in TypeScript (with tests!). I'll be following the chapter layout of [A Common-Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms, Second Edition, 2nd Edition](https://pragprog.com/titles/jwdsal2/a-common-sense-guide-to-data-structures-and-algorithms-second-edition/). I know nothing about it other than that it's got lots of great reviews.

## Why?

I took DS&A two years ago and I need a refresher. Also, that class was taught using C++ and I'd like to take the opportunity to learn more about TypeScript. I also need to learn more about testing, so there will be lots of those included here too.

## Okay, why TypeScript?

I like JavaScript. I also like languages like Java, and I'm pretty sure I'd enjoy C#, so I'm going with TypeScript because it's a bit like a lexical mashup of JS and C#. It's also super stylish to know in the web dev community (for now).

## Who are you?

I'm Jeff Caldwell, a recent obtainer of a CS bachelor. I'm looking for work as a software developer. I especially love making websites and web apps and I'm most proficient in frontend dev (though I really enjoy writing server-side as well).

## What's in the box?

Nothing much yet! I'm just getting started on this project.
